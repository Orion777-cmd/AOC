    "Starting items lists your worry level for each item the monkey is currently holding in the order they will be inspected.\n",
    "Operation shows how your worry level changes as that monkey inspects an item. (An operation like new = old * 5 means that your worry level after the monkey inspected the item is five times whatever your worry level was before inspection.)\n",
    "Test shows how the monkey uses your worry level to decide where to throw an item next.\n",
    "If true shows what happens with an item if the Test was true.\n",

Monkey 0 goes first, then monkey 1, and so on until each monkey has had one turn. The process of each monkey taking a single turn is called a round.\n",

A monkey that starts a round with no items could end up inspecting and throwing many items by the time its turn comes around.
